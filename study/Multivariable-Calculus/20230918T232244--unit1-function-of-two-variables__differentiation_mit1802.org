Partial derivative Geometric meaning :
The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) evaluated at point
\(x_0 ,y_0 \) can be approximated by :
\[
f_x(x_0,y_0) = \frac{{f(x_0 + \Delta x , y_0) - f(x_0,y_0) }}{\Delta x}
\]

So partial derivative of \( x \) measures how \( f \) changes  if we
increase \( x \) by small amount 

similarly partial derivative with respect to \( y \) at point \(
(x_0,y_0) \) is given by
\[
f_y = \frac{{f(x_0 , y_0 + \Delta y ) - f(x_0 , y_0) }}{\Delta x } 
\]

So partial derivative of \( y \) measures how \( f \) changes if we
increase \( y \) by small amount
