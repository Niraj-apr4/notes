* Exceptions 
+ SyntaxError :: Python cant parse program
+ NameError :: Local or global name not found
+ AttributeError :: Attribute refrence fails
+ Type Error :: Operator doesnot have the correct type
+ IOError :: IO system report malfunction
  
   
* What to do with the Exception
+ *Stop* Execution , signal error conditon
+ in python *Raise an exception*
  /raise Exception ("descriptive String")/

* Dealing with Exceptions
1. try-except block
#+begin_src python
  try:
     # <statements>
     # <statements>
     # <statements>
  except :
     # excuted when try block raise any kind of exceptions
     # <statements>
  #executed when try else block finishes of executions
  #<statements>
  #<statements>
  #<statements>
#+end_src

2. use seperate clauses to deal with particular type of exceptions
   #+begin_src python :results output
     try:
	 # <statements>
	 # <statements>
	 print('1'/0)
     except ValueError :
	 # executed if try block has Value error
	 # <statements>
	 # <statements>
	 print("try block has value error")
     except ZeroDivisionError :
	 # executed if try block has zeroDivisionError
	 # <statements>
	 # <statements>
	 # <statements>
	 print("cannot devide by zero")
     except :
	 # executed if try block has error other
	 # than ValueErro and ZeroDivisionError
	 # <statements>
	 # <statements>
	print("all other kind of error ")
     # executed when try-except block has finished executing
     #<statements>
     #<statements>
     print("outside try except block")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : all other kind of error 
   : outside try except block
